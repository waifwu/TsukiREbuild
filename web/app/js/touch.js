// first pointer is a finger (touchFirst); on any other the page is as it was: nothing below is installed, and the rules
// of touch.css all hang on html.touch. What a mouse or a key did, a finger does this way:
//   the story     a tap advances; a swipe down brings the control panel (the quick bar, at a finger's size), a swipe up the
//                 log; a finger held still fast forwards while it stays; a tap with two fingers hides the text
//   Back          the game's own touch Back button (native 0x4a410: back_btn at the bottom right, sliding in from the edge)
//   the menus     an item lights as it is pressed and is chosen by the tap; lists move under the finger
//   portrait      a screen asks for the device to be turned, and the game is held under it as under a hidden tab
// The screens' own parts (larger plates, wider rows, the two-tap rule of choices and the flowchart) are in ui.js,
// gallery.js, flowchart.js and home.js, each behind ui.touch, with their measures here (TOUCH).

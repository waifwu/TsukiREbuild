// home.js - the page the game opens on: five tabs on the game's own panel, ABOUT (what this project is and how it was made, welcome.js), GITHUB (the source),
// DOWNLOAD (the game as an app: Windows and Android to download, macOS and Linux to build), SAVE DATA (the browser's saves to and from the game's own save
// file, savefile.js) and PLAY ONLINE, whose PRESS ANY BUTTON starts the game; that press is also the click a browser wants before it plays sound.
// Built as the quick bar is (ui.js buildPanel), from the game's art: the mode panel's strip with five of its plates relettered, the title's picture under the
// system menu's sky, Config's inner panel, the game's scroll bar and help band, and the title's own prompt.
// It opens on every visit, for everyone, with no tab chosen and no plate lit: the column holds only the game's logo and a line naming the plates, so
// a stray tap starts nothing. Not where the address asks for a scene (?script, for tests and the scene links in ABOUT's Extras).
// The Android and desktop apps (web-dev/android, web-dev/desktop) open on it too, with four tabs (tabsFor): ABOUT, GITHUB, SAVE DATA and PLAY, the
// site's PLAY ONLINE under the app's name for it. There is no DOWNLOAD there (it is the download) and no language to choose (the apps are built
// without the Japanese files, lang.js); PLAY's page has the app's updates instead (update.js). What a browser does for the page the app does
// through apphost.js: Export's file goes where the player chooses, and a link opens in the system's browser.
